<h3>Procedure:</h3>
<ol>
        <li>Check your power supply. Power interruption may damage storage beyond repair.</li>
        <li>Make sure that no backup job is running.</li>
        <li>Do not click any buttons until all check and repair operations are completed. Do not start any processes!</li>
        <li>Run filesystem check first.</li>
        <li>If you see any errors in the log, run filesystem repair.</li>
        <li>When the repair operation is finished, power down the machine and unplug the storage devices before boot.</li>
