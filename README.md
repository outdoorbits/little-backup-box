# Little Backup Box

Little Backup Box is a software that transforms a Raspberry Pi (or any single-board computer running a Debian-based Linux distribution) into an inexpensive, fully-automatic, pocketable backup appliance. While the primary purpose of Little Backup Box is to serve as a photo backup device, it's not limited to this specific usage scenario.

## Little Backup Box features

- Back up data from one USB storage device to another. Little Backup Box supports all types of USB solid-state storage devices and all mainstream formats.
- Transfer photos and RAW files directly from a camera to an external USB storage device. If your camera is supported by gPhoto2 software, it will work with Little Backup Box.
- Use multiple source devices. Little Backup Box assigns a unique ID to each source device and create a separate folder for it on the backup drive.
- Perform backup automatically, without any user interaction.
- Manage Little Backup Box via a web UI.
- Stream the backed up contents to DLNA-compatible clients.
- Access the backed up contents from other machines on the network.
- Manage the backed up contents using a web-based file browser.
- Push the backed up contents to a cloud storage service.
- Perform user-defined actions using custom buttons.

## Installation

1. Create a bootable SD card with the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS Lite for use with Little Backup Box.
2. Make sure that your Raspberry Pi is connected to the internet.
3. Run the following command on the Raspberry Pi: `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefans73/little-backup-box/main/install-little-backup-box.sh | bash`

Little Backup Box supports three backup modes:

- **Source backup** Automatically backs up the contents of a source device (e.g., a storage card) to an external storage device.
- **Camera backup** Transfers photos, RAW files, and videos from the camera connected directly to the Raspberry Pi. The transferred files are saved in the _/home/pi/BACKUP/[CAMERA MODEL]_ directory on the system storage card. **Important** Make sure that the camera is set to the MTP USB connection mode.
- **Internal backup** Automatically backs up the contents of a source dive to the internal storage.

During the installation, choose the desired mode from the selection dialog.

When prompted, reboot the Raspberry Pi.

## Usage

The exact steps depend on the backup mode.

### web UI

The web UI allows you to control and manage Little Backup Box using any device with a browser. 

1. Point the browser to _http://127.0.0.1:8000_ (replace _127.0.0.1_ with the actual IP address of the Raspberry Pi).
2. Start the desired action by pressing the appropriate button.

- Use the **System info** navigation link to access basic system information, such as a list of storage devices and memory usage.
- To edit the configuration file, use the **Settings** navigation link.
- Use the **Upload** navigation link to switch to the upload form.

### Source backup mode

1. Boot the Raspberry Pi.
2. Plug in a backup storage device.
3. Plug the source device into the Raspberry Pi.
4. Wait till the Raspberry Pi shuts down.

**Note:** To differentiate between different source devices, the backup script creates a datetime-based *.id* file in the root of each source. The name of the *.id* file is also used as the destination backup folder on the storage device.

### Camera backup mode

1. Boot the Raspberry Pi.
2. Connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi.
3. Turn the camera on.
4. Wait till the Raspberry Pi shuts down.

### Internal backup mode

1. Boot the Raspberry Pi.
2. Plug a storage source into the Raspberry Pi.
3. Wait till the Raspberry Pi shuts down.
